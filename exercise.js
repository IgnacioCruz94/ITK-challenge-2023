/**
 * Write a JavaScript function that takes two matrices of integers as input and returns
 * a new matrix that is the sum of the two input matrices. Both input matrices will have
 * the same number of rows and columns. The sum of the matrices is calculated by adding
 * the corresponding elements from both matrices.
 *
 * Instructions:
 * - Add your logic in sumOfMatrices function, do not modify the arguments.
 * - Verify that both matrices have the same number of rows and columns. Otherwise,
 *   throw an exception with the message "Matrices must have the same number of rows and columns."
 * - Verify that none is empty, otherwise, throw an exception with the message "Empty mtrices are not allowed."
 *
 * Example:
 * Given the following input matrices:
 *
 * Matrix 1:
 * [ [1, 2, 3],
 *   [4, 5, 6],
 *   [7, 8, 9] ]
 *
 * Matrix 2:
 * [[10, 11, 12],
 * [13, 14, 15],
 * [16, 17, 18]]
 *
 * The function should return the following matrix:
 *
 * Output Matrix:
 * [[11, 13, 15],
 * [17, 19, 21],
 * [23, 25, 27]]
 *
